<p align="center">Jammming is a React JS web application that saves user's created playlist to their Spotify account. It will prompt the user to sign in to their spotify account and grant access in order to do so when they first open the web application.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://jammming-by-courressa-malcolm.netlify.app/">Jammming</a> will display a list of songs based on what the user searches. The user will then have the option to add the song to their playlist that they are creating with the plus button or they may select an arrow to see more information about the selected song. In the section that displays more information they will be able to view the album cover, album title, artist(s), popularity based on scoring retrieved from Spotify, a preview of the song if available as well as the option to listen to the full song on Spotify. Users can choose to remove a song either with the minus icon or the X icon. Once they are satisfied with the songs they have added to their playlist they would add a title to the playlist and select "Save to Spotify" for their playlist to be sent to their Spotify account.</p>
